   <h2>VISORS</h2>


   <p>Visors in football are a cool unqiue feature to the helemt that first arrived in the 1980s.
    VIsors provide eye protection from UV rays and stadium lights and even other players.
    In 1998 an NFL player went down with a head injury while wearing a dark tinted visor 
    and the medical staff couldnt see the players eyes causing his injuries to be even worse.
    The leauge then banned any tinted visors unless a doctor note was permitted.
